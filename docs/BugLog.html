<dt id="Fix-tokenization-issue-c109"><b>Fix tokenization issue c109</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Automated random testing produced an error tokenizing the following code fragment:</p>

<pre><code>    s s(..)(.)sss
    ;</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to &#39;s/(..)(.)//s&#39; with &#39;s&#39; as the delimiter instead of &#39;/&#39;. It was tokenized correctly except when the final &#39;s&#39; was followed by a newline, as in the example. When the delimiter is a letter rather than a punctuation character, perltidy exercises some seldom-used code which had an off-by-one loop limit. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>Automated random testing produced an error tokenizing the following fragment:</p>

<dt id="Fix-coding-error-issue-c104"><b>Fix coding error, issue c104</b></dt>

<p>Automated random testing produced an error with something like the following input line taken from an obfuscated perl script:</p>

<pre><code>    open(IN, $ 0);</code></pre>

<p>The &#39;0&#39; was missing in the output:</p>

<pre><code>    open( IN, $ );</code></pre>

<p>The tokenization was correct, but a line of code in the formatter which removes the space between the &#39;$&#39; and the &#39;0&#39; should have used a &#39;defined&#39; when doing a check:</p>

<pre><code>    $token .= $word if ($word);             # OLD: error</code></pre>

<p>This if test fails on &#39;0&#39;. The corrected line is</p>

<pre><code>    $token .= $word if ( defined($word) );  # NEW: fixes c104</code></pre>

<p>This fixes the problem and gives the correct formatted result</p>

<dt id="Fix-undefined-variable-reference-c102"><b>Fix undefined variable reference, c102</b></dt>

<p>Random testing produced an undefined variable reference for the following input</p>

<pre><code>    make_sorter ( sort_sha =&gt; sub {sha512 ( $_} );
    make_sorter ( sort_ids =&gt; sub {/^ID:(\d+)/} );</code></pre>

<p>when formatted with the following input parameters:</p>

<pre><code>    --space-function-paren
    --maximum-line-length=26
    --noadd-newlines</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the input script has a peculiar syntax error - the last two closing tokens of the first line are transposed. (Ironically, this snippet is taken from code which accompanied the book Perl Best Practices). The perltidy tokenizer caught the syntax error, but the formatter touched an undefined variable while attempting to do the formatting. It would be possible to just skip formatting for errors like this, but it can sometimes help finding bugs to see an attempted formatting. So the formatter coding has been corrected to avoid the undefined variable reference.</p>

<p>This fixes issue c102.</p>

<dt id="Some-blocks-with-side-comments-exceed-line-length"><b>Some blocks with side comments exceed line length</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>In some rare cases, one-line blocks with side comments were exceeding the line length limit. These usually had a semicolon between the closing block brace and the side comment. For example:</p>

<pre><code>        my $size
            = do { local $^W; -f $local &amp;&amp; -s _ }; # no ALLO if sending data from a pipe</code></pre>

<p>This update breaks the one-line block in an attempt to keep the total length below the line length limit. The result on the above is:</p>

<pre><code>        my $size = do {
            local $^W;
            -f $local &amp;&amp; -s _;
        };    # no ALLO if sending data from a pipe</code></pre>

<p>Note that this break can be prevented by including the flag --ignore-side-comment-lengths or -iscl.</p>

<dt id="Fix-c091-incorrect-closing-side-comment"><b>Fix c091, incorrect closing side comment</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>An error was discovered and corrected in the behavior of the --closing-side-comment (-csc) flag when only subs were being marked with the setting -cscl=&#39;sub&#39;. The problem was that in rare cases a closing paren could be marked with &#39;## end&#39;. The cause of the problem is that the pattern matching regex which was generated for this case happens to match an empty string, and it could happen that certain parens had empty strings as block names. This was fixed in two ways. First, the regex was fixed so that it cannot match an empty string. Second, a test for an empty string was added.</p>

<dt id="Fix-issue-c081--cscw-preventing-deletion-of-closing-side-comments"><b>Fix issue c081, -cscw preventing deletion of closing side comments</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Random testing revealed a problem in which an old closing side comment was not being deleted when it fell below the interval specified on -csci=n and the -cscw flag was also set.</p>

<p>For example, the following snippet has been formatted with -csc -csci=1. The interval -csci=1 insures that all blocks get side comments:</p>

<pre><code>    if ($x3) {
        $zz;
        if ($x2) {
            if ($x1) {
                ..;
            } ## end if ($x1)
            $a;
            $b;
            $c;
        } ## end if ($x2)
    } ## end if ($x3)</code></pre>

<p>If we then run with -csc -csci=6, the comment ## end if ($x1) will fall below the threshold and be removed (correctly):</p>

<pre><code>    if ($x3) {
        $zz;
        if ($x2) {
            if ($x1) {
                ..;
            }
            $a;
            $b;
            $c;
        } ## end if ($x2)
    } ## end if ($x3)</code></pre>

<p>But if we also add the -cscw flag (warnings) then it was not being removed. This update fixes this problem (issue c081).</p>

<dd>

<p>In the following snippet, the final one-line anonymous sub is not followed by a comma. This caused the -lp mode to revert to standard indentation mode because a forced line break was being made after the closing sub brace:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD, perltidy -lp
    $got = timethese(
        $iterations,
        {
          Foo =&gt; sub { ++$foo },
          Bar =&gt; &#39;++$bar&#39;,
          Baz =&gt; sub { ++$baz }
        }
    );</code></pre>

<p>An update was made to check for and fix this.</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW, perltidy -lp
    $got = timethese(
                      $iterations,
                      {
                         Foo =&gt; sub { ++$foo },
                         Bar =&gt; &#39;++$bar&#39;,
                         Baz =&gt; sub { ++$baz }
                      }
    );</code></pre>

<p>But note that this only applies to one-line anonymous subs. If an anonymous sub is broken into several lines due to its length or complexity, then these forced line breaks cause indentation to revert to the standard indentation scheme.</p>

<dd>

<p>Testing with random parameters produced a formatting instability related to the -vmll flag. The problem was due to a subtle difference in the definition of nesting depth and indentation level. The vertical aligner was using nesting depth instead of indentation level to compute the maximum line length when -vmll is set. In some rare cases there is a difference. The problem was fixed by passing the maximum line length to the vertical aligner so that the calculation is only done in the formatter. This fixes b1209.</p>

<p>Testing with random parameters produced another instability caused by misparsing an &#39;x&#39; operator after a possible file handle. This is very similar to b1205, but involves a sigil immediately following a times operator.</p>

<pre><code>    sub x {print &quot;arg is $_[0]\n&quot;}
    my $num = 3;

<p>Testing with random parameters produced an instability caused by misparsing an &#39;x&#39; operator after a possible file handle. Testing with Perl showed that an &#39;x&#39; followed by a &#39;(&#39; in this location is always the &#39;times&#39; operator and never a call to a function &#39;x&#39;. If x is immediately followed by a number it is subject to the usual weird parsing rules at such a location.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider what these statements do:</p>

<dd>

<p>Testing with random input parameters produced a number of cases of unstable formatting. All of these involved some combination of a short maximum line length, a large -ci and -i, and often one or more of -xci -lp and -wn. These parameters can force lines to break at poor locations. All of these cases were fixed by introducing a quantity called the &#39;stress_level&#39;, which is the approximate indentation level at which the line break logic comes under high stress and become unstable. For default parameters the stress level is about 12, but unusual parameter combinations can make it much less, even as low as zero. For code which is at an indentation level greater than this depth, some defensive actions are taken to avoid instability, such as temporarily turning off the -xci flag when the indentation depth exceeds the stress level. Most actual working code will not be influenced by this logic. Actual code which has a very deep indentation level can avoid problems by using a long line length, a short number of indentation spaces, or even the whitespace-cycle parameter.</p>

<dd>

<p>This issues can be illustrated with the following input script:</p>

<pre><code>    {
        if ($xxx) {
          ...
        } ## end if ($xxx ...
        # b &lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt; [&lt;condition&gt;]

    {
        if ($xxx) {

        } ## end if ($xxx ...
                        # b &lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt; [&lt;condition&gt;]
    }</code></pre>

<p>The comment &#39;# b ..&#39; moved over to the column 21 to the right as if it were a side comment. The reason is that it accidentally got marked as a hanging side comment. It should not have been because the previous side comment was a closing side comment. This update fixes this:</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: perltidy -fpsc=21
    {
        if ($xxx) {
            ...;
        } ## end if ($xxx ...

        # b &lt;filename&gt;:&lt;line&gt; [&lt;condition&gt;]

<dd>

<p>This issue is illustrated with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>   my $aa = $^ ? &quot;defined&quot; : &quot;not defined&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>If we tell perltidy to remove the space before the &#39;?&#39;, then the output will no longer be a valid script:</p>

<pre><code>   # perltidy -nwls=&#39;?&#39;:
   my $aa = $^? &quot;defined&quot; : &quot;not defined&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that Perl considers &#39;$^?&#39; to be a special variable. So Rerunning perltidy on this gives an error, and perl also gives an error. This update fixes the problem by preventing a space after anything like &#39;$^&#39; from being removed a new special variable would be created.</p>

<dt id="Fix-unusual-parsing-problem-issue-c065"><b>Fix unusual parsing problem issue c065</b></dt>

<p>Testing produced an unusual parsing problem in perltidy which can be illustrated with the following simple script:</p>

<pre><code>    my $str = &#39;a&#39;x2.2;
    print $str,&quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>Normally an integer would follow the &#39;x&#39; operator, but Perl seems to accept any valid number and truncates it to an integer. So in this case the number 2.2 is truncated to 2 and the output is &#39;aa&#39;.</p>

<p>But perltidy, with default parameters, formats this as</p>

<pre><code>    my $str = &#39;a&#39; x 2 . 2;
    print $str,&quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>which prints the result &quot;aa2&quot;. The problem is fixed with this update. With the update, the result is</p>

<pre><code>    my $str = &#39;a&#39; x 2.2;
    print $str, &quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>This update corrects a rare loss of vertical alignment in welded containers.</p>

<p>To illustrate the issue, the normal formatting of the following snippet is</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -sil=1 
    ( $msg, $defstyle ) = do {
            $i == 1 ? ( &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Color&quot; )

          :           ( &quot;Then&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; );
    };</code></pre>

<p>If it appears within a welded container, the alignment of the last line was being lost:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD: perltidy -wn -sil=1
    { {

        ( $msg, $defstyle ) = do {
                $i == 1 ? ( &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Color&quot; )
              : $i == 2 ? ( &quot;Then&quot;,  &quot;Rarity&quot; )
              : ( &quot;Then&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; );
        };
    } }</code></pre>

<p>The corrected result is</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: perltidy -wn -sil=1
    { {

        ( $msg, $defstyle ) = do {
                $i == 1 ? ( &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Color&quot; )

              :           ( &quot;Then&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; );
        };
    } }</code></pre>

<p>Several other minor vertical alignment issues are fixed with this updated. The problem was that two slightly different measures of the depth of indentation were being compared in the vertical aligner.</p>

<dt id="Fix-edge-case-of-formatting-instability-b1189"><b>Fix edge case of formatting instability, b1189</b>.</dt>
<dd>

<p>Testing with random parameters produced a case of unstable formatting involving welding with parameter -notrim-qw. The problem was that the -notrim-qw flag converts a qw quote into a quote with fixed leading whitespace. The lines of these types of quotes which have no other code are output early in the formatting process, since they have a fixed format, so welding does not work. In particular, the closing tokens cannot be welded if they are on a separate line. This also holds for all types of non-qw quotes. So welding can only be done if the first and last lines of a non-qw quote contain other code. A check for this was added.</p>

<p>For example, in the following snippet the terminal &#39;}&#39; is alone on a line:</p>

<pre><code>    is eval(q{
        $[ = 3;
        BEGIN { my $x = &quot;foo\x{666}&quot;; $x =~ /foo\p{Alnum}/; }
        $t[3];
    }
    ), &quot;a&quot;;</code></pre>

<p># In the previous version this was half-welded: # OLD: perltidy -wn -sil=0</p>

<pre><code>    is eval( q{
        $[ = 3;
        BEGIN { my $x = &quot;foo\x{666}&quot;; $x =~ /foo\p{Alnum}/; }
        $t[3];
    }
      ),
      &quot;a&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>The new check avoids welding in this case, giving</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: perltidy -wn -sil=0
    is eval(
        q{
        $[ = 3;
        BEGIN { my $x = &quot;foo\x{666}&quot;; $x =~ /foo\p{Alnum}/; }
        $t[3];
    }
      ),
      &quot;a&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>Welding can still be done if the opening and closing container tokens have other code. For example, welding can be done for the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>    is eval(q{
        $[ = 3;
        BEGIN { my $x = &quot;foo\x{666}&quot;; $x =~ /foo\p{Alnum}/; }
        $t[3];
    }), &quot;a&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>And welding can still be done on all qw quotes unless the -notrim-qw flag is set.</p>

<p>The first problem is that testing with random parameters produced some examples of formatting instabilities involving applying --keyword-group-blanks to complex structures, particularly welded structures. The -kgb parameters work well on simple statements or simple lists, so a check was added to prevent them from working on lists which are more than one level deep. This fixes issues b1177 and b1178 without significantly changing the -kgb functionality.</p>

<p>The second problem is that a terminal blank line could be misplaced if the last statement was a structure. This is illustrated with the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>    sub new {
      my $class = shift;
      my $number = shift || croak &quot;What?? No number??\n&quot;;
      my $classToGenerate = shift || croak &quot;Need a class to generate, man!\n&quot;;
      my $hash = shift; #No carp here, some operators do not need specific stuff
      my $self = { _number =&gt; $number,
                   _class =&gt; $classToGenerate,
                   _hash =&gt; $hash };
      bless $self, $class; # And bless it
      return $self;
    }

    # OLD: perltidy -kgb -sil=0 gave
    sub new {

        my $class           = shift;
        my $number          = shift || croak &quot;What?? No number??\n&quot;;
        my $classToGenerate = shift || croak &quot;Need a class to generate, man!\n&quot;;
        my $hash = shift;   #No carp here, some operators do not need specific stuff
        my $self = {
            _number =&gt; $number,

            _class =&gt; $classToGenerate,
            _hash  =&gt; $hash
        };
        bless $self, $class;    # And bless it
        return $self;
    }</code></pre>

<p>The blank line which has appeared after the line &#39;_number =&gt;&#39; was intended to go after the closing brace but a line count was off. This has been fixed:</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: perltidy -kgb -sil=0 gives
    sub new {

        my $class           = shift;
        my $number          = shift || croak &quot;What?? No number??\n&quot;;
        my $classToGenerate = shift || croak &quot;Need a class to generate, man!\n&quot;;
        my $hash = shift;   #No carp here, some operators do not need specific stuff
        my $self = {
            _number =&gt; $number,
            _class  =&gt; $classToGenerate,
            _hash   =&gt; $hash
        };

        bless $self, $class;    # And bless it
        return $self;
    }</code></pre>

<p>This fixes issue c048.</p>

<dt id="Fix-to-keep-from-losing-blank-lines-after-a-code-skipping-section"><b>Fix to keep from losing blank lines after a code-skipping section</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A problem in the current version of perltidy is that a blank line after the closing code-skipping comment can be lost if there was a blank line before the start of the code skipping section. For example, given the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    $x = 1;

    #&lt;&lt;V
    % # = ( foo =&gt; &#39;bar&#39;, baz =&gt; &#39;buz&#39; );
    print keys(%#), &quot;\n&quot;;
    #&gt;&gt;V

    @# = ( foo, &#39;bar&#39;, baz, &#39;buz&#39; );
    print @#, &quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>running perltidy gives:</p>

<pre><code>    $x = 1;

    #&lt;&lt;V
    % # = ( foo =&gt; &#39;bar&#39;, baz =&gt; &#39;buz&#39; );
    print keys(%#), &quot;\n&quot;;
    #&gt;&gt;V
    @# = ( foo, &#39;bar&#39;, baz, &#39;buz&#39; );
    print @#, &quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the blank line after the closing comment #&gt;&gt;V is missing. What happened is that the formatter is counting blank lines and did not &#39;see&#39; the code skipping section. So the blank after the closing comment looked like the second blank in a row, so it got removed since the default is --maximum-consecutive-blank-lines=1.</p>

<p>This update fixes this by resetting the counter. This fixes case c047. A simple workaround until the next release is to include the parameter</p>

<p>--maximum-consecutive-blank-lines=2, or -mbl=2.</p>

<p>It can be removed after the next release.</p>

<dd>

<p>Testing with random parameters produced some cases where the combination of -wn and various -bbxx=n flags were not working together. To illustrate, consider the following script (-sil=1 just means start at 1 indentation level)</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -sil=1
    $$d{&quot;day_name&quot;} = [
        [
            &quot;lundi&quot;,    &quot;mardi&quot;,  &quot;mercredi&quot;, &quot;jeudi&quot;,
            &quot;vendredi&quot;, &quot;samedi&quot;, &quot;dimanche&quot;
        ]
    ];</code></pre>

<p>With welding we get:</p>

<pre><code>    # -sil=1 -wn
    $$d{&quot;day_name&quot;} = [ [
        &quot;lundi&quot;,    &quot;mardi&quot;,  &quot;mercredi&quot;, &quot;jeudi&quot;,
        &quot;vendredi&quot;, &quot;samedi&quot;, &quot;dimanche&quot;
    ] ];</code></pre>

<p>With -bbsb=3 (--break-before-square-brackets) we get:</p>

<pre><code>    # -sil=1 -bbsb=3
    $$d{&quot;day_name&quot;} =
      [
        [
            &quot;lundi&quot;,    &quot;mardi&quot;,  &quot;mercredi&quot;, &quot;jeudi&quot;,
            &quot;vendredi&quot;, &quot;samedi&quot;, &quot;dimanche&quot;
        ]
      ];</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. But for the combination -bbsb=3 -wn we get</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD: ERROR
    # -sil=1 -bbsb=3 -wn
    $$d{&quot;day_name&quot;} = [ [
        &quot;lundi&quot;,    &quot;mardi&quot;,  &quot;mercredi&quot;, &quot;jeudi&quot;,
        &quot;vendredi&quot;, &quot;samedi&quot;, &quot;dimanche&quot;
    ] ];</code></pre>

<p>which is incorrect because it ignores the -bbsb flag. The corrected result is</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: OK
    # -sil=1 -bbsb=3 -wn
    $$d{&quot;day_name&quot;} =
      [ [
        &quot;lundi&quot;,    &quot;mardi&quot;,  &quot;mercredi&quot;, &quot;jeudi&quot;,
        &quot;vendredi&quot;, &quot;samedi&quot;, &quot;dimanche&quot;
      ] ];</code></pre>

<p>This update fixes case b1173. It works for any number of welded containers, and the -bbxxi=n flags also work correctly.</p>

    push @subs, sub { my $i=shift; $i %= @words; print &quot;$words[$i] &quot;; return $subs[0]};
    $subs[0](0)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11);
    print &quot;\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>However perltidy was giving an error message at the &#39;)(&#39; combination, which is unusual in perl scripts. This update fixes this.</p>

<p>These are function call parens, so logically they should be under control of the -sfp or --space-function-parens parameter. I wrote a patch to do this, but decided not to implement it. The reason is that, as noted in the manual, subtle errors in perl scripts can occur when spaces are placed before parens. So, to avoid possible problems, the -sfp parameter will be restricted to spaces between a bareword [assumed to be a function] and a paren.</p>

<p>In some very rare circumstances it was possible to trigger a &quot;Program error&quot; message. The program still ran to completion.

<dt id="Rewrite-coding-for--bom-flag"><b>Rewrite coding for -bom flag</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Random testing produced some examples of formatting instability involving the -bom flag in combination with certain other flags which are fixed with this update. As part of this update, a previous update to fix case b977 (21 Feb 2021, commit 28114e9) was revised to use a better criterion for deciding when not to keep a &#39;)-&gt;&#39; break. The previous criterion was that the opening and closing containers should be separated by more than one line. The new criterion is that they should contain a list. This still fixes case b977. Another case, b1120, was fixed by requiring that only parentheses expressions be considered for keeping a line break, not &#39;}-&gt;&#39; or &#39;]-&gt;&#39;.</p>

<p>Some issues are illustrated in the following examples using &#39;-bom -gnu&#39;. In the first example the leading &#39;)-&gt;&#39; was being lost due to the old b977 fix:</p>

<pre><code>    # input:
    $show = $top-&gt;Entry( &#39;-width&#39; =&gt; 20,
                       )-&gt;pack(&#39;-side&#39; =&gt; &#39;left&#39;);

    # OLD: perltidy -gnu -bom
    $show = $top-&gt;Entry(&#39;-width&#39; =&gt; 20,)-&gt;pack(&#39;-side&#39; =&gt; &#39;left&#39;);

    # NEW: perltidy -gnu -bom
    $show = $top-&gt;Entry(
                        &#39;-width&#39; =&gt; 20,
                       )-&gt;pack(&#39;-side&#39; =&gt; &#39;left&#39;);</code></pre>

<p>In the following example a leading &#39;-&gt;&#39; was being lost. The NEW version keeps the leading &#39;-&gt;&#39; but has to give up on the -lp alignment because of complexity:</p>

<p>The welding process uses a tolerance to keep results stable. Basically, a zero tolerance is used if it looks like it is welding an existing weld, while a finite tolerance is used otherwise. The effect is to reject a few marginal welds to gain stability. The coding to do this was simplified and the tolerance was made more precise to fix case b1124.</p>

<p>Another change with this update is that at welded containers, the value of the -ci flag of an outer opening token is transferred to the inner opening token. This may improve some indentation in a few cases if the -lp flag is also used. It has no effect if -lp is not used.</p>

<dt id="Improve-indentation-of-welded-multiline-qw-quotes"><b>Improve indentation of welded multiline qw quotes</b></dt>

<p>Formatting of multiline qw lists with welding works best if the opening and closing qw tokens are on separate lines, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -wn
    my $mon_name = ( qw(
        January February March April
        May June July August
        September October November December
    ) )[$mon];

    # perltidy -wn -lp
    my $mon_name = ( qw(
                     January February March April
                     May June July August
                     September October November December
    ) )[$mon];</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise formatting can be poor, particularly if the last line has text and a closing container.</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD: perltidy -wn
    my $mon_name = ( qw(January February March April
        May June July August
    September October November December) )[$mon];</code></pre>

<p>Note that perltidy does not change the line breaks within multiline quotes, so they must be changed by hand if desired.</p>

<p>This update indents the last line of a multiline quote which contains both text and the closing token, such as:</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW: perltidy -wn
    my $mon_name = ( qw(January February March April
        May June July August
        September October November December) )[$mon];</code></pre>

<p>This update is only when the -lp flag is not used. If -lp is used and the last line contains text, the last line is still outdented:</p>

<pre><code>    $ OLD and NEW: perltidy -wn -lp
    my $mon_name = ( qw(January February March April
                     May June July August

<p>This is difficult to fix. The best solution is to place the closing qw containers on a separate line.</p>

<dd>

<p>The wording regarding when -lp reverts to the default indentation scheme has been revised to include side comment as follows:</p>

<p>In situations where perltidy does not have complete freedom to choose line breaks it may temporarily revert to its default indentation method. This can occur for example if there are blank lines, block comments, multi-line quotes, or side comments between the opening and closing parens, braces, or brackets.</p>

<p>The word &#39;may&#39; is significant for side comments. In a list which is just one level deep side comments will work (perhaps with -iscl if side comments are long). For example this is ok</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -lp
    $gif-&gt;arc(
               50, 50,     # Center x, y.
               30, 30,     # Width, Height.
               0,  360,    # Start Angle, End Angle.
               $red
    );</code></pre>

<p>But if a list is more than one level deep then the default indentation is used.</p>

<p>Testing with random parameters produced a case in which a brace following an unknown bareword was marked by the tokenizer as a code block brace rather than a hash brace. This can cause poor formatting. The problem was solved by having the tokenizer send a signal to the formatter if a block type was guessed. The formatter has more information and can fix the problem. This fixes case b1085.</p>

<p>Perltidy does final formatting in discrete batches of tokens, where a batch is a continuous section of the total token list. A batch begins a new line and will be broken into one or more lines. If a batch starts with a blank token it will simply be skipped on output. However, some rare problems have been found in random testing which can occur if a batch starts with a blank. An example is case b984 which has the following parameters:</p>

<pre><code>        # this is file &#39;b984.pro&#39;

          {       return &quot;unknown&quot;;

<p>This is a small change to the update of 13 Feb 2021, f79a4f1. Random testing produced additional blinking states caused by the combination of -vtc=2 and -vmll flag, plus several others. The problem was that a line length check in the vertical aligner was being skipped as an optimization if it didn&#39;t appear necessary. The unusual properties of the -vmll flag require that the check always be done.</p>

<p>In the process of fixing this issue, a glitch was discovered in the previous coding of the -bl (braces-left) flag that caused somewhat random results for block types sort/map/grep/eval. The problem was a conflict between the logic for forming one-line blocks and the logic for applying the -bl flag. Usually, -bl formatting was not applied to these block types, but occasionally it was. To minimize changes in existing formatting, in the new version the -bl flag is not applied to these block types. A future flag could be added to give user control over which of these block types are under -bl control.</p>

<p>The problem is that a bare closing qw paren was not being outdented if the flag &#39;-nodelete-old-newlines is set. For example</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD (OK, outdented): perltidy -ci=4 -xci
    {
        modules =&gt; [
            qw(

    # OLD (indented) : perltidy -ndnl -ci=4 -xci
    {
        modules =&gt; [
            qw(
                JSON

                JSON
            )
        ],
    }</code></pre>

<p>The problem happened because the -ndnl flag forces each line to be written immediately, so the next line (which needs to be checked in this case) was not available when the outdent decision had to be made. A patch to work around this was added 24 Jan 2021, 52996fb.</p>

<dt id="Some-issues-with-the--lp-option"><b>Some issues with the -lp option</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Random testing revealed some problems involving the <b>-lp</b> option which are fixed with this update.</p>

<p>The problem is illustrated with the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -lp
    Alien::FillOutTemplate(
                &quot;$main::libdir/to-$main::desttype/$main::filetype/spec&quot;,
                &quot;$workdir/$fields{NAME}-$fields{VERSION}-$fields{RELEASE}.spec&quot;,
                %fields
    );</code></pre>

<p>which alternately formats to this form</p>

<pre><code>    # perltidy -lp
    Alien::FillOutTemplate(
                &quot;$main::libdir/to-$main::desttype/$main::filetype/spec&quot;,
                &quot;$workdir/$fields{NAME}-$fields{VERSION}-$fields{RELEASE}.spec&quot;,
                %fields );</code></pre>

<p>when formatted with the single parameter <b>-lp</b>. A number of similar examples were found in testing. The problem was traced to the treatment of the space which perltidy tentatively adds wherever there is a newline, just in case the formatted output has different line breaks. The problem was that the indentation level of these spaces was being set as the level of the next token rather than the previous token. Normally the indentation level of a space has no effect, but the <b>-lp</b> option does use it and this caused the problem. This was fixed 23 Jan 2021, edc7878.</p>

<p>The problem was traced to welding to the opening hash brace. A rule was added to prevent this, and testing with a large body of code showed that it did not significantly change existing formatting. With this change, the above snippet formats in the stable state</p>

<p>with the following parameters</p>

<pre><code>    --maximum-line-length=20
    --indent-columns=9

<p>The problem was that the token &#39;FILE&#39; was either parsed as type &#39;Y&#39; or &#39;Z&#39; depending on the existence of a subsequent space.

    --maximum-line-length=31
    --break-before-square-bracket-and-indent=2
    --break-before-square-bracket=1
    --noadd-whitespace</code></pre>

<p>The problem was found to be caused by the -bbsb parameters causing the indentation level of the first square bracket to change depending upon whether the term was broken on input or not. Two fixes would correct this. One is to turn off the option if the -ci=n value exceeds the -i=n value. The other is to require a broken container to span at least three lines before turning this option on. The latter option was made to sub &#39;adjust_container_indentation&#39;. With this change the snippet remains stable at the second state above. Fixed 14 Jan 2021, 5c793a1.</p>

<p>All of the listed parameters are required to cause this, but the main cause is the very large continuation indentation and short line length. Welding was being turned on and off in this case.

<p>The bareword &#39;pi2&#39; was not recognized and the text between the two slashes was a taken as a possible pattern argument in a parenless call to pi2. Two fixes were made to fix this.

Second, the fact that the first slash was followed by a number should have tipped the guess to favor division, so this was fixed. As it was, a backup spacing rule was used, which favored a pattern.</p>

<p>In the old version the last side comment was aligned before the closing paren was attached to the previous line, causing the final side comment to be far to the right. A patch in the new version just places it at the default location. This is the best than can be done for now, but is preferable to the old formatting. 3 Jan 2021, e57d8db.</p>

<dt id="Improve-rule-for-forgetting-last-side-comment-location"><b>Improve rule for forgetting last side comment location</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The code which aligns side comments remembers the most recent side comment and in some cases tries to start aligning at that column for later side comments. Sometimes the old side comment column was being remembered too long, causing occasional poor formatting and causing a noticeable and unexpected drift of side comment locations to the right. The rule for forgetting the previous side comment column has been modified to reduce this problem. The new rule is essentially to forget the previous side comment location at a new side comment with different indentation level or significant number of lines without side comments (about 12). The previous implementation forgetting changes in indentation level across code blocks only. Below is an example where the old method gets into trouble and the new method is ok:</p>

<pre><code>        # OLD:
        foreach my $r (@$array) {
            $Dat{Data}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } = join( &quot;;&quot;, @$r );    # store all info
            my $name = $Dat{GivenName}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } || $r-&gt;[1];

            # pass array as ad-hoc string, mark missing values
            $Dat{Data}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } = join(
                &quot;;&quot;,
                (
                    uc $r-&gt;[0], uc $name,                   # symbol, name
                    $r-&gt;[2],    $r-&gt;[3], $r-&gt;[4],           # price, date, time
                    $r-&gt;[5],    $r-&gt;[6],                    # change, %change
                    $r-&gt;[7],    &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;,    # vol, avg vol, bid,ask
                    $r-&gt;[8],               $r-&gt;[9],     # previous, open
                    &quot;$r-&gt;[10] - $r-&gt;[11]&quot;, $r-&gt;[12],    # day range,year range,
                    &quot;-&quot;,                   &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;

        }</code></pre>

<p>The second side comment is at a deeper indentation level but was not being forgotten, causing line length limits to interfere with later alignment. The new rule gives a better result:</p>

<pre><code>        # NEW:
        foreach my $r (@$array) {
            $Dat{Data}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } = join( &quot;;&quot;, @$r );    # store all info
            my $name = $Dat{GivenName}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } || $r-&gt;[1];

            # pass array as ad-hoc string, mark missing values
            $Dat{Data}{ uc $r-&gt;[0] } = join(

                (
                    uc $r-&gt;[0], uc $name,               # symbol, name
                    $r-&gt;[2],    $r-&gt;[3], $r-&gt;[4],       # price, date, time
                    $r-&gt;[5],    $r-&gt;[6],                # change, %change
                    $r-&gt;[7],    &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;,          # vol, avg vol, bid,ask

                    &quot;-&quot;,                   &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;-&quot;
                )
            );    # eps,p/e,div,yld,cap
        }</code></pre>

<p>The following example shows an unexpected alignment in the cascade of trailing comments which are aligned but slowly separating from their closing containers:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD:
    {
        $a = [
            Cascade    =&gt; $menu_cb,
            -menuitems =&gt; [
                [ Checkbutton =&gt; &#39;Oil checked&#39;, -variable =&gt; \$OIL ],
                [
                    Button   =&gt; &#39;See current values&#39;,
                    -command =&gt; [
                        \&amp;see_vars, $TOP,

                    ],    # end see_vars
                ],        # end button
            ],            # end checkbutton menuitems
        ];                # end checkbuttons cascade
    }</code></pre>

<p>This was caused by forgetting side comments only across code block changes. The new result is more reasonable:</p>

<pre><code>    # NEW:
    {
        $a = [
            Cascade    =&gt; $menu_cb,
            -menuitems =&gt; [
                [ Checkbutton =&gt; &#39;Oil checked&#39;, -variable =&gt; \$OIL ],
                [
                    Button   =&gt; &#39;See current values&#39;,
                    -command =&gt; [
                        \&amp;see_vars, $TOP,

                    ],    # end see_vars

<dt id="improve-formatting-of-multiline-qw"><b>improve formatting of multiline qw</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>This update adds a sequence numbering system for multiline qw quotes. In the perltidy tokenizer normal container pair types, like { }, (), [], are given unique serial numbers which are used as keys to data structures. qw quoted lists do not get serial numbers by the tokenizer, so this update creates a separate serial number scheme for them to correct this problem. One formatting problem that this solves is that of preventing the closing token of a multiline quote from being outdented more than the opening token. This is a general formatting rule which should be followed. Without a sequence number, the closing qw token could not lookup its corresponding opening indentation so it had to resort to a default, breaking the rule, as in the following:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD, perltidy -wn
    # qw line
    if ( $pos == 0 ) {

              make test install force reload look
        ) ); #&lt;-- outdented more than &#39;sort&#39;
    }

    # Here is the same with a list instead of a qw; note how the
    # closing sort paren does not outdent more than the &#39;sort&#39; line.
    # This is the desired result for qw.

<p>In the process of making vertical alignments, lines which are simple lists of items are treated different from other lines. The old method for finding and marking these lines had a few problems which are corrected with this update. The main problem was that the old method ran into trouble when there were side comments. For example, the old method was not marking the following list and as a result the two columns of values were not aligned:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD
    return (
        $startpos, $ldelpos - $startpos,         # PREFIX

        $ldelpos + 1, $endpos - $ldelpos - 2,    # CONTENTS
        $endpos - 1, 1,                          # CLOSING BRACKET
        $endpos, length($$textref) - $endpos,    # REMAINDER
    );

    # NEW
    return (
        $startpos,    $ldelpos - $startpos,           # PREFIX
        $ldelpos,     1,                              # OPENING BRACKET
        $ldelpos + 1, $endpos - $ldelpos - 2,         # CONTENTS
        $endpos - 1,  1,                              # CLOSING BRACKET
        $endpos,      length($$textref) - $endpos,    # REMAINDER
    );</code></pre>

<p>Another problem was that occasionally unwanted alignments were made between lines which were not really lists because the lines were incorrectly marked. For example (note padding after first comma)</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD: (undesirable alignment)
    my ( $isig2, $chisq ) = ( 1 / ( $sig * $sig ), 0 );
    my ( $ym,    $al, $cov, $bet, $olda, $ochisq, $di, $pivt, $info ) =

For example, the closing qw paren below was indented with continuation indentation but would not have that extra indentation if it followed the default -cpi setting for a paren:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD:

For example (&#39;&gt;&#39; is outdented):</p>

<pre><code>    @EXPORT = (
        qw&lt;
          i Re Im rho theta arg
          sqrt log ln

<p>There is a step in vertical alignment where the alignments are formed into a tree with different levels, and some deeper levels are pruned to preserve lower level alignments. This usually works well, but some deeper alignments will be lost, which is what was happening in the example below. It turns out that if the tree pruning is skipped when alignment depths increase monotonically across lines, as in the example, then better overall alignment is achieved by the subsequent &#39;sweep&#39; pass.</p>

<dt id="Improved-some-marginal-vertical-alignments"><b>Improved some marginal vertical alignments</b></dt>

<p>This update fixed a rare situation in which some vertical alignment was missed. The problem had to do with two lines being incorrectly marked as a marginal match. A new routine, &#39;match_line_pairs&#39; was added to set a flag with the information needed to detect and prevent this. This fix was made 13 Dec 2020, 9a8e49b.</p>

<dt id="Do-not-align-equals-across-changes-in-continuation-indentation"><b>Do not align equals across changes in continuation indentation</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A rule was added to prevent vertical alignment of lines with leading &#39;=&#39; across a change in continuation indentation. Sometimes aligning across a change in CI can come out okay, but sometimes it can be very poor. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    # BAD:
    $!               = 2, die qq/$0: can&#39;t stat -${arg}&#39;s &quot;$file&quot;./
        unless $time = ( stat($file) )[$STAT_MTIME];

    # FIXED:
    $! = 2, die qq/$0: can&#39;t stat -${arg}&#39;s &quot;$file&quot;./
      unless $time = ( stat($file) )[$STAT_MTIME];</code></pre>

<p>The second line is a continuation of the first, and this update prevents this alignment. The above &#39;BAD&#39; formatting was in the previous developmental version of perltidy, not the previous release. This update added 12 Dec 2020, 5b56147.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Improve-vertical-alignment-in-some-two-line-matches"><b>Improve vertical alignment in some two-line matches</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>When two lines would be perfectly aligned except for the line length limit, previously they would only be aligned if they had a common leading equals. The update removes this restriction and allows as many alignments to be made as possible. The results are generally improved. This update was made 11 Dec 2020, f3c6cd8. Some examples:</p>

<p># In this example the side comments were limiting the matches</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD
    shift @data if @data and $data[0] =~ /Contributed\s+Perl/;    # Skip header
    pop @data if @data and $data[-1] =~ /^\w/;    # Skip footer, like

    # NEW
    shift @data if @data and $data[0]  =~ /Contributed\s+Perl/;    # Skip header
    pop @data   if @data and $data[-1] =~ /^\w/;    # Skip footer, like</code></pre>

<p># The same is true here.</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD
    if ($tvg::o_span) { $tvg::hour_span = $tvg::o_span; }
    if ( $tvg::hour_span % 2 &gt; 0 ) { $tvg::hour_span++; }    # Multiple of 2

    # NEW
    if ($tvg::o_span)              { $tvg::hour_span = $tvg::o_span; }
    if ( $tvg::hour_span % 2 &gt; 0 ) { $tvg::hour_span++; }    # Multiple of 2</code></pre>

<p>In the next example, the first comma is now aligned but not the second, because of the line length limit:</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD
    is( MyClass-&gt;meta, $mc, &#39;... these metas are still the same thing&#39; );
    is( MyClass-&gt;meta-&gt;meta, $mc-&gt;meta, &#39;... these meta-metas are the same thing&#39; );

    # NEW
    is( MyClass-&gt;meta,       $mc, &#39;... these metas are still the same thing&#39; );
    is( MyClass-&gt;meta-&gt;meta, $mc-&gt;meta, &#39;... these meta-metas are the same thing&#39; );</code></pre>

<p>In this last example, the first comma is not aligned, but alignment resumes after the second comma.</p>

<pre><code>    # OLD
    is( $obj-&gt;name, $COMPRESS_FILE, &quot;   Name now set to &#39;$COMPRESS_FILE&#39;&quot; );
    is( $obj-&gt;prefix, &#39;&#39;, &quot;   Prefix now empty&quot; );

    # NEW
    is( $obj-&gt;name, $COMPRESS_FILE, &quot;   Name now set to &#39;$COMPRESS_FILE&#39;&quot; );

<dt id="Improve-vertical-alignment-in-some-marginal-matches"><b>Improve vertical alignment in some marginal matches</b></dt>

<p>In perltidy a &#39;marginal match&#39; occurs for example when two lines share some alignment tokens but are somewhat different. When this happens some limits are placed on the size of the padding spaces that can be introduced. In this update the amount of allowed padding is significantly increased for certain &#39;good&#39; alignment tokens. Results of extensive testing were favorable provided that the change is restricted to alignments of &#39;=&#39;, &#39;if&#39; and &#39;unless&#39;. Update made 10 Dec 2020, a585f0b.</p>

<dt id="Improve-vertical-alignment-of-lines-ending-in-fat-comma"><b>Improve vertical alignment of lines ending in fat comma</b></dt>

<p>A minor adjustment was made to the rule for aligning lines which end in &#39;=&gt;&#39;. When there are just two lines in an alignment group, the alignment is avoided if the first of the two ends in a &#39;=&gt;&#39;. Previously, alignment was avoided if either ended in a &#39;=&gt;&#39;. The old rule was preventing some good alignments in a later stage of the iteration. In the following example, the last two lines are processed separately because they do not match the comma in &#39;sprintf&#39;. The new rule allows the fat comma alignment to eventually get made later in the iteration. Update made 9 Dec 2020, ca0ddf4.</p>

<p>In developing an improved convergence test, an issue slowing convergence was found related to signed numbers as in the following line,</p>

<pre><code>    @london = (deg2rad(-  0.5), deg2rad(90 - 51.3));</code></pre>

<p>The leading &#39;-&#39; here is separated from the following number &#39;0.5&#39;. This is handled by tokenizing the minus as type &#39;m&#39; and the number as type &#39;n&#39;. The whitespace between them is removed in formatting, and so the space is gone in the output. But a little problem is that the default rule for placing spaces within the parens is based on the token count, after the first formatting the result is</p>

<pre><code>    @london = ( deg2rad( -0.5 ), deg2rad( 90 - 51.3 ) );</code></pre>

<p>The next time it is formatted, the &#39;-0.5&#39; counts as one token, resulting in</p>

<pre><code>    @london = ( deg2rad(-0.5), deg2rad( 90 - 51.3 ) );</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the space within the parens around the &#39;-0.5&#39; is gone. An update was made to fix this, so that the final state is reached in one step. This fix was made 23 Nov 2020, f477c8b.</p>

<dt id="fix-to-prevent-conversion-of-a-block-comment-to-hanging-side-comment"><b>fix to prevent conversion of a block comment to hanging side comment</b></dt>

<p>A rare situation was identified during testing in which a block comment could be converted to be a hanging side comment. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    sub macro_get_names {    #
    #
    # %name = macro_get_names();  (key=macrohandle, value=macroname)
    #
        local (%name) = ();
        ...
    }</code></pre>

<p>For the following specific conditions the block comment in line 2 could be converted into a hanging side comment, which is undesirable:</p>

<pre><code>   1. The line contains nothing except for a &#39;#&#39; with no leading space
   2. It follows a line with side comment
   3. It has indentation level &gt; 0</code></pre>

<p>An update was made to prevent this from happening. There are two cases, depending on the value of --maximum-consecutive-blank-lines, or -mbl. If this value is positive (the default) then a blank line is inserted above the block comment to prevent it from becoming a hanging side comment. If this -mbl is zero, then the comment is converted to be a static block comment which again prevents it from becoming a hanging side comment. This fix was made 23 Nov 2020, 2eb3de1.</p>

<dt id="more-types-of-severe-errors-will-prevent-formatting"><b>more types of severe errors will prevent formatting</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Files for which &#39;severe errors&#39; are found have always been output verbatim rather than being formatted. The definition of &#39;severe error&#39; has been expanded to include a final indentation level error greater than 1, more than 2 brace errors, and more than 3 &quot;unexpected token type&quot; parsing errors. The goal is to avoid formatting a non-perl script or a perl script with severe errors. So for example the following snippet has a level error of 2</p>

<pre><code>  {{{{
  }}</code></pre>

<p>was previously output with default parameters as</p>

<pre><code>  { 
      {
          {
              {}
          }</code></pre>

<p>along with an error message. But now it is just output verbatim as</p>

<pre><code>  {{{{
  }}</code></pre>

<p>A statement such as the following was generating an error message at the colon:</p>

<pre><code>   state $a : shared;</code></pre>

<p>The problem was that &#39;state&#39; was not in the list of keywords. This has been fixed and the line now parses without error. The &#39;state.t&#39; test file for perl 5.31 now formats without error. This was added 18 Oct 2020 in &quot;add &#39;state&#39; as keyword&quot;, d73e15f.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="sub-signatures-no-longer-parsed-with-prototypes"><b>sub signatures no longer parsed with prototypes</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Simple signatures (those without commas) were being parsed with code originally written for prototypes. This prevented them from being formatted with the usual formatting rules. This was changed so that all signatures are now formatted with the normal formatting rules. For example:</p>

<pre><code> # Old, input and after formatting:
 sub t123 ($list=wantarray) { $list ? &quot;list&quot; : &quot;scalar&quot; }

 # New, after formatting
 sub t123 ( $list = wantarray ) { $list ? &quot;list&quot; : &quot;scalar&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>Notice that some spaces have been introduced within the signature. Previously the contents of the parens not changed unless the parens contained a list.</p>

<p>This change introduced a problem parsing extended syntax within signatures which has been fixed. In the following snippet, the &#39;:&#39; caused a parsing error which was fixed.</p>

<pre><code>  # perltidy -sal=&#39;method&#39;
  method foo4 ( $class : $bar, $bubba ) { $class-&gt;bar($bar) }</code></pre>

<p>The &#39;:&#39; here is given a type of &#39;A&#39;. This may be used to change the spacing around it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>  # perltidy -sal=&#39;method&#39; -nwls=&#39;A&#39;
  method foo4 ( $class: $bar, $bubba ) { $class-&gt;bar($bar) }</code></pre>

<p>This update was added 18 Oct 2020, in &#39;format all signatures separately from prototypes&#39;, e6a10f3. The test file &#39;signatures.t&#39; distributed with perl5.31 formats without error now.</p>

<dt id="fix-parsing-problem-with"><b>fix parsing problem with $#</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A problem with parsing variables of the form $# and $#array was found in testing and fixed. For most variables the leading sigil may be separated from the remaining part of the identifier by whitespace. An exception is for a variable beginning with &#39;$#&#39;. If there is any space between the &#39;$&#39; and &#39;#&#39; then the &#39;#&#39; starts a comment. So the following snippet is has valid syntax and is equivalent to $ans=40;</p>

<pre><code>    my $ #
    #
    ans = 40;</code></pre>

<p>This was being misparsed and was fixed 17 Oct 2020, in &#39;fixed parsing error with spaces in $#&#39; a079cdb.</p>

<p>During testing the following error was found and fixed. Given the following input snippet:</p>

<pre><code>    get(
        on_ready =&gt; sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready-&gt;end;
            return;
        },
        on_exit =&gt; sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );</code></pre>

<p>The resulting formatting was</p>

<pre><code>    get(
        on_ready =&gt; sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready-&gt;end;
            return;
        }, on_exit =&gt; sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the break after the comma has been lost. The problem was traced to a short-cut taken by the code looking for one-line blocks. The unique circumstances in which this occurred involved a hash of anonymous subs, one with a signature with multiple parameters and short enough to be a one-line block, as in the last sub definition line. This was fixed 17 Oct 2020 in &#39;fix missing line break for hash of subs with signatures&#39;, 51428db.</p>

<p>Problems with parsing prototypes and signatures were found during testing and fixed 17 Oct 2020 in &#39;fixed problem parsing multi-line signatures with comments&#39;, 017fd07. For example the following snippet was mis-parsed because of the hash mark.</p>

<pre><code>    sub test ( # comment ))) 
        $x, $x) { $x+$y }</code></pre>

<p>Complex signature expressions such as the following are now parsed without error:</p>

<pre><code>    sub t086
        ( #foo)))
        $ #foo)))
        a #foo)))

<pre><code>   my $masksize = ceil( Opcode::opcodes / 8 );    # /</code></pre>

<p>This problem was discovered in random testing. When a slash follows a bareword whose prototype is not known to perltidy, it has to guess whether the slash starts a pattern or is a division. The guessing logic was rewritten and improved 14 Oct 2020 in &#39;rewrote logic to guess if divide or pattern&#39;, afebe2f.</p>

<pre><code>    $z = sqrt($x**2 + $y**2)
      ;</code></pre>

<p>In testing it was found not to be doing this after braces which require semicolons, such as &#39;do&#39; and anonymous subs. This was fixed 12 Oct 2020 in &#39;fix -bos to work with semicolons after braces&#39;, 03ee7fc. For example</p>

<pre><code>    my $dist = sub {
        $z = sqrt( $x**2 + $y**2 )

<pre><code>                use overload
                    &#39;+&#39; =&gt; sub {
                        print length $_[2], &quot;\n&quot;;
                        my ( $x, $y ) = _order(@_);
                        Number::Roman-&gt;new( int $x + $y );
                    },
                    &#39;-&#39; =&gt; sub {

                    },
                    ...</code></pre>

<p>This keeps the list from shifting to the right and can avoid problems in formatting the list with certain styles, including with the -xci flag. Fixed 12 Oct 2020 in &#39;keep break after use overload statement&#39;, 8485afa.</p>

<p>This flag causes continuation indentation to &quot;extend&quot; deeper into structures.

<dt id="Keep-any-space-between-a-bareword-and-quote"><b>Keep any space between a bareword and quote</b></dt>

<p>In random testing, the -mangle option introduced a syntax error by deleting the space between barewords and quotes (test file &#39;MxScreen&#39;), such as:</p>

<p>The .LOG file reports any disagreements between the indentation of the input and output files. This can help locate brace errors.

This was corrected 24 Sep 2020, &#39;fixed incorrect log entry for indentation disagreement&#39;, 3d40545. At the same time, locations of closing brace indentation disagreements are now tracked and reported in the .ERR file when there is a brace error.

<p>Previously only a complaint was given, which went into the log file and was not normally seen.

<p>Perltidy joined &#39;$#&#39; and &#39;eq&#39; to get $#eq, but should have stopped at the line end to get $# followed by keyword &#39;eq&#39;. (Note that $# is deprecated). This was fixed 11 Sep 2020 in &quot;fixed several fringe parsing bugs found in testing&quot;, 85e01b7.</p>

<p>This problem can be illustrated with the following test snippet which was not correctly parsed.</p>

<pre><code> print$$ &lt;300?&quot;$$&lt;300\n&quot;:$$&lt;700?&quot;$$&lt;700\n&quot;:$$&lt;2_000?&quot;$$&lt;2,000\n&quot;:$$&lt;10_000?&quot;$$ &lt;10,000\n&quot;:&quot;$$&gt;9,999\n&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>The problem is related to the &#39;&lt;&#39; symbol following the &#39;$$&#39; variable, a possible filehandle, and is similar to a previous bug. The problem was corrected 11 Sep 2020 in &quot;fixed several fringe parsing bugs found in testing&quot;, 85e01b7. The line now correctly formats to</p>

<pre><code> print $$ &lt; 300  ? &quot;$$&lt;300\n&quot;

<p>A file with incorrect bracing which effectively gave negative indentation caused a crash when a stack was referenced with a negative index. The problem was fixed 8 Sept 2020 in &quot;convert array to hash to avoid trouble with neg levels in bad files&quot;, a720e0d.</p>

<p>This error can be demonstrated with this line.</p>

<pre><code>  print $i &lt;10 ? &quot;yes&quot; : &quot;no&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>Perl has some strange parsing rules near a possible filehandle, and they change over time. The &#39;&lt;&#39; here is a less than symbol, but perltidy expected that it might be the start of an angle operator, based on the old rules, and gave a warning. The formatting was still correct, but the warning was confusing. This has been fixed 8 Sep 2020 in &#39;remove confusing warning message&#39;, 0a4d725.</p>

<p>This problem arose in several scripts involving the parameter --line-up-parentheses plus one or more of the vertical tightness flags. It can be illustrated with the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>    perltidy --line-up-parentheses --paren-vertical-tightness=1

    if (

 #!$wd/perl
 EOB print &quot;\$^X is $^X, \$0 is $0\n&quot;;

<p>The problem is that the -x flag tells perltidy not to start parsing until it sees a line starting with &#39;#!&#39;, which happens to be in a here-doc in this case.</p>

<h1 id="Open-Issues">Open Issues</h1>

<p>These are known issues which have not been fixed.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="lexical-subs-not-fully-supported"><b>lexical subs not fully supported</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Basic parsing of lexical subs works but some aspects of lexical subs are not yet functional. One of these is that unlike regular subs, lexical subs can override names of builtin functions.</p>

<p>First consider the following snippet</p>

<pre><code>  sub s { 
    my $arg=$_[0];
    print &quot;s called with arg $arg\n&quot;;
  }
  s(1);
  s(2);</code></pre>

<p>The &#39;s&#39; in the two last lines is the builtin s function, not the sub. Both perltidy and perl make the same assumption here. This program happens to still run but prints nothing. It will not run if the last semicolon is removed.</p>

<p>Now consider the following snippet in which the sub has a preceding &#39;my&#39;</p>

<pre><code>  use feature &#39;lexical_subs&#39;, &#39;signatures&#39;;
  my sub s { 
    my $arg=$_[0];
    print &quot;s called with arg $arg\n&quot;;
  }
  s(1);
  s(2);</code></pre>

<p>The builtin function &#39;s&#39; is replaced by the sub s here, and the program runs. Perltidy will format this but it is assuming that the s in the two last lines are the builtin s function. If the last semicolon is removed, there will be an formatting error. So perltidy and perl make different assumptions in this case.</p>

<p>Another issue is that perltidy does not yet remember the extent of the scope of a lexical sub.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="issues-with-paren-less-calls"><b>issues with paren-less calls</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Consider the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>  use Test::More;
  ok open($stdin, &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $1), &#39;open ... &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $magical_fileno&#39;, ||  _diag $!;</code></pre>

<p>Note the unusual situation of a comma followed by an &#39;||&#39;. Perltidy will format this satisfactorily but it will write an error message. The syntax is correct, however. Perl knows the prototype of the &#39;ok&#39; function, which is called here without parens, so the last comma marks the last arg and is needed to keep the || from attaching to the last arg.</p>

<p>Full support of paren-less calls will probably never be implemented in perltidy because it would require that it parse all of the modules used to find the prototypes. This would make it impossible to run perltidy on small snippets of code from within an editor.</p>

<p>The problem can be avoid if parens are used:</p>

<pre><code>  ok ( open($stdin, &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $1), &#39;open ... &quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;, $magical_fileno&#39;) ||  _diag $!;</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="multiple-sub-paren-calls"><b>multiple sub paren calls</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Perltidy currently flags as an error a closing paren followed by an opening paren, as in the following</p>

<pre><code>  $subsubs[0]()(0)</code></pre>

<p>This syntax is ok. The example is from test &#39;current_sub.t&#39; in perl5.31.</p>
